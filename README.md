# CalculatorExample
Convenient little app if you need a calculator that only adds things.  Follows these rules:

1) a number following a number extends that number (ex: typing 3 after typing 3 will result in "33")
2) a number following the "=" operator begins a new set
3) the "=" operator following an addition will add the last added value to the stack
4) the "C" operator will begin a new number set
5) a number, followed by the "+" operator, followed by another number and another operator, will return the sum of the stack
